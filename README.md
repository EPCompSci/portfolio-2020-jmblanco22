Hello, I'm Jose Blanco, and this is a portfolio for the apps and projects I have worked on during 2020. Starting in the 1st semester of the 2020-21 school year, I began learning Swift in my high school's iOS App Development class. Building on the fundamental coding principles I learned from programming in Java and Swift, I gained exposure to Swift syntax and XCode formatting through online videos and research.

I've worked with about 5 apps so far each one dealing with something different such as games,trivia games, landmarks, and helpful apps. Using Xcode I've experimented with randomizers, UI displays (stack views, segues, view controllers),small amount of sprite kits, integrating formating object, drop down menus,  and incorporating logic based functions. Although these apps are functional there is alot i want to improve in these apps. However, it is a good start, and I believe it reflects my learning experience well. 

## Programming Experience
* Swift: Intermediate (began late 2020)
* Java: Intermediate (began 2019)
* R: Beginner (began summer of 2020)
* Html: Intermediate(began late 2020)
* Css: Intermediate(began 2021)
* Python: Intermediate (began late 2021)


## Apps
### [Landmarks](https://github.com/jmblanco22/LandMarks)
Landmarks is one of my favorite apps even though it is very beginner level because it was my first working project I made that also had pretty good formatting and use of Api's.

### [TravelApp](https://github.com/jmblanco22/TravelApp)
This is an App I made for the congressional app challange, which was not fully finished but the idea of the app was there because it would give suggestions of places in the world and you could tap on them and it would tell you all about it and then you would hit book now if you liked the place.

### [Ephs App](https://github.com/connorholm/EPHS-App) 
The Ephs App is a group app that my classmates and I are working on to better our school. We have many features that we've added to the app such as, login page, tutorial page, assignments page, navigation menu, a profile page,and a club page. There is still much to work on this app but we have made many advancements so far.

### [CarRacer](https://github.com/jmblanco22/CarRacer)
CarRacer it's an app I wanted to make since the beginning of this class, it is a 2d Racer App, what makes it difficult is you can play by yourself two-sided so you have to see both sides and have to have a faster reaction time to not crash into the cars to see what your high score will be, or you can play with a friend and see who is the first one to lose or first one to win.

## [App Websites](https://github.com/jmblanco22/App-websites)
I made Websites for three different apps, one app made by myself and others made by other developers. These websites use simple HTML,CSS and a little bit of javascript.
