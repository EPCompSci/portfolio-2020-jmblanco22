2018-2019 Portfolio

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!
